# Changelog: 0.0.1 -> 0.0.2

## Major Features

### Class-Based Routing
The core feature of this release is the introduction of `Route` and `RouteMeta`. This allows developers to group related API endpoints into classes, providing a cleaner structure than standalone functions.
- **Route Class**: Base class for all route groups.
- **Inheritance**: `class Users(Route):` automatically sets up the routing machinery.
- **Custom Paths**: Override the `path` class attribute (e.g., `path = "/custom-users"`) or let the system derive it from the class name (e.g., `UserProfiles` -> `/user-profiles`).

### Smart Method Naming
JEC-API now automatically parses method names to determine HTTP verbs and path structures, reducing boilerplate decorators.

| Method Pattern | HTTP Verb | Generated Path |
|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| `get` | GET | `/` |
| `post` | POST | `/` |
| `get_by_id` | GET | `/{id}` |
| `delete_by_id` | DELETE | `/{id}` |
| `get_users` | GET | `/users` |
| `post_batch_update` | POST | `/batch-update` |
| `get_user_by_id` | GET | `/user/{id}` |

### Pydantic Model Integration
The `RouteMeta` class inspects type hints to automatically detect Pydantic models.
- **Body Parameters**: If a method argument is typed as a Pydantic model (subclass of `BaseModel`), it is automatically treated as a request body.
- **FastAPI Compatibility**: Helper wrappers ensure FastAPI's dependency injection system recognizes these models correctly.

### Auto-Discovery
New `Core.discover()` method allows for recursive scanning of packages to find and register `Route` classes automatically.
- **Usage**: `app.discover("my_project.routes")`
- **Recursive**: Scans sub-modules by default.

### Core Application Wrapper
The `Core` class now inherits directly from `FastAPI`, providing a seamless drop-in replacement that adds:
- `register(route_class)`: For manual registration.
- `discover(package)`: For auto-registration.
- `get_registered_routes()`: Introspection helper.
